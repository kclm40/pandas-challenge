# Two Observations:

*Looking at the Score by School size analysis, medium-sized schools have the highest overall score with 90.62%, driven primarily by their high % Reading Score.

*Looking at the Scores by School spending, we see that schools that spend less than $584 have the highest overall passing percent with 90.37. This is driven by higher math and reading scores.
